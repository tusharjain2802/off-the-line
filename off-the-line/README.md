# Be Warned!
This code is not very good :( I hacked a lot of this together, so you'll find a lot of copy/paste, anti-patterns, hacks, spaghetti code, and bad stuff in general. You have been warned! (sorry)

# Description
Action! Danger! Coins! What more could you want from a game?! Jump off the line and try not to die or throw your keyboard across the room in this twitchy arcade tapper. Can you beat all 20 hand-crafted levels? It's harder than it sounds! Good luck and watch out for those walls!
